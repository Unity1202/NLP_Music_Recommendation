Quevedo ft. Aitana
[Intro: Quevedo & Aitana]
(I'll say it wasn't you)
(The one who kissed me with trepidation)
Hehehe
Ah-ah
Hey, Aitana
Good night, good night, yeah
Good night, good night, yeah
Hey, hey


[Pre-Chorus: Quevedo]
He lives in Madrid, but he doesn't usually go out
That last night was an exception
We saw each other in a pre and it all started there
Drinking we talked about nothing and at the same time about everything
And just as soon as we got to the party we kissed
But she asked me to go on the sly
That her friends shouldn't find out (Ah-ah)
And I don't know why, but if you ask me, baby


[Chorus: Quevedo]
I'll say it wasn't you
The one who kissed me with trepidation
Mommy, she's got me' bellaco, but why so much mystery?
With the note I don't know how to take all' this seriously
What I do know is that it was you
The one who was bitchin' me with that cuckoo
The confusion has got me spinning, my bad girl
And if they're waiting for you at home, why are you sleeping at mine?


[Verse 1: Aitana]
I just want to see you again so you can secretly give it to me
In that hotel on Gran Via pick me up at 3 o'clock
If you want to, don't give me your heart, eh?
Because this is not love, it's just sex, yeah
Tremendous fantasy you and me non-stop
If I don't call you, don't take it personal
My bed is still cold, come warm me up
Don't worry, just trust me, no one's gonna find out
I saved your phone number under another name
No one can know, no one can know
What tonight we both do, no one can see it


[Chorus: Quevedo & Aitana].
I'll say it wasn't you
The one who kissed me with trepidation


Mommy, he's got me all twisted up, but what's with all the mystery?
With the note I don't know how to take all this seriously.
I know it was you
The one that drove you crazy with my cu
In the car we're driving around Gran Via
You don't sleep in your house, you sleep in mine (Hey)


[Verse 2: Quevedo]
That cat's a gyal, bichiyal, like Bad Bo
Ask for whatever she wants, I'll take care of it (Yeah)
Nails done, mommy, and hair long
I'm waiting for you to tell me to do something
I'm waiting for you to tell me to do something, yeah
That I'll settle for giving you one time a month
That night don't go away, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
My mind, then why not repeat it again?
I don't know what your fantasy is, but I know what mine is
And there's no place, there's no date, there's no time, but there's you, baby
I know you didn't know me and the least I wanted to do
Was to fall in love, but it's too late now, baby


[Bridge: Aitana & Quevedo]
Sorry, baby
But I don't believe in love, no
Tell me if you wanna have a good time
But don't put your heart in it, let's put your skin in it (The skin; hehehehe)


[Refrain: Aitana & Quevedo]
I'll say it wasn't you
The one who kissed me with trepidation
I got you bellaco, but why so much mystery?
Baby, take it down a notch, don't take it so seriously
I'll say it was you
The one who was bitchin' me with that cu
Confusion's got me all twisted up, my bad
And if they're waiting for you at home, why are you sleeping at mine?


[Outro: Aitana]
(You don't sleep at your house, you sleep at mine)

[Intro]
Hey


[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I know that you said that you were very happy alone
But I can't believe it seeing the songs on your playlist (From your playlist)
And seeing that you talked to me and deleted the message at this hour'.
What are you doing online at this hour'?


[Chorus]
She looks like she's single, mommy, the confidence with which she moves (Yes)
Shorty looks like she don't hang out with just anybody, but she never sleeps alone, she's always up all night' (Mommy)
And subе storie' looking for someone the same (Same), she doesn't forget the one who treated her bad (Ah-ah)
Mommy, that's why she always pulls me at dawn with the excuse that she wants to fuck, but just to pretend
She looks like she's single, mami, the confidence with which she moves the
Shorty looks like she doesn't hang out with just anyone, but she never sleeps alone, she's always up all night.
And she goes upstairs looking for someone the same (Equal), she doesn't forget the one who treated her badly (Ah)
Mommy, that's why she always pulls me up at dawn with the excuse that she wants to fuck


[Verse] 
And if she calls me to fuck, I don't call her either.
But her gallery is full of my pictures
Don't think I didn't see 'em, mami, but I played crazy
Sorry, I'm goin' crazy, I wanna taste that toto
Like in Plaza 2019, that's where I was bitchin''
There was no hindrance', no time', no look'.
Now when he calls' it's because you miss him'.
And you're satisfied' with me when you imagine his face
But, shorty, that of uploading “Si Tú Te Vas” in your storie'.
For me to see, you're feeling lonely
Send me his ubi, I'll get him with the forty
In my combo somo' forty too


[Bridge]
How come you're so bad when you were so fine?
I don't want you to be with me, mommy, just talk straight to me
Throw me out when I want to, but forget it first
I'm gonna keep on waiting for you, ma


[Chorus] [Chorus
She looks like she's single, mommy, the confidence with which she moves the (La, la)
Shorty looks like she don't hang out with just anybody, but she never sleeps alone, she's always awake (-la', -la', -la')
And she climbs storie' looking for someone just like her (Just like her), she doesn't forget the one who treated her bad (Ah-ah)
Mommy, that's why she always pulls me at dawn with the excuse that she wants to fuck (Yes, ma)

[Intro]
Hey
Good night, baby, yeah
Hey, hey
Hey, hey


[Chorus]
Private afterparty, fashion shows
Accompanied always, she's never alone
And even if she's not engaged, wedding ring' and diamond'.
Accompanied always, but always alone


[Post-Chorus]
But she always looks at me when I'm behind her
At the photocall she answers the press by looking at me (Yeah)
I didn't know you spoke Spanish
And even though I'd seen you on TV (Tele)
She's' tougher in person (-sona)
Accompanied always, but always alone


[Verse]
I don't know what got into you with me, what did you see me (Yeah)
You grew up in this environment
Pa' me everything is so new, I have to tell you (I have, I have, I have, I have to tell you)
At the first gala I saw you, baby, in my ear you said: (Woh-oh)
“You're different, being here makes you sad too.”
And she told me her story, her screenwriter father, formerly in Hollywood (Hey).
Her mother a ballerina, starred in the Moscow Ballet.
She never did it out of pride, but they show her the garments before they sell them.
First brand, she closes the store for herself
Among so much difference, we are the same, just the same (Just the same)
Of circle' different', different' street' (Street')
It's just that coincidence' like this only happens once.
So, baby, let's take advantage that the night is long
And if you want it, it takes longer for the sun to rise
I respect your stylist, but you look better without a dress (Better)
Take off that hairdo, if you want it can make noise (Shh)
I'm not so formal, stop being so proper with me
Take out all the knave stuff with me




[Refrain]
Private afterparty (Private afterparty), fashion shows (Fashion shows)
Accompanied always (Always), she's never alone (No)
And even if she's not engaged (Hey), wedding ring' and diamond' (Wedding)
Accompanied always (Always), but always alone (Always)


[Bridge]
After that night we went our separate ways
She's always in company, but she doesn't feel so lonely anymore (Ah)
She's no longer summering in Santorini, now she camouflages herself among the people (Ah)
And I see her smile calmer (Hey), she's learned to obey her feelings


[Chorus]
No private after-party (Ah-ah-ah), no fashion shows (Ah-ah-ah).
Now she's always alone, but she's enough on her own
And she don't want to be engaged, no wedding ring' and diamond' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Now she's alone all the time, but she's enough on her own, ah-ah-ah


[Outro]
Good night, baby

Qué pasaría
Rauw Alejandro ft. Bad Bunny
[Intro: Bad Bunny]
What would happen if those nights inside you came back?
It felt so good when I put it in you
You know what we did
And now, without planning, we saw each other in the club


[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
What would happen if it were just us?
In a bed, hey, hey, remembering
How I used to give it to you, your friend's already gone
Why are you staying? You're missing something, baby, and


[Post-Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
I've got it, girl, I've got it, baby
I've got it and I'll give it to you tonight (Wouh)
Her song is playing, her song is playing
You see her, but nobody knows her
Don't think about it anymore, don't think about it anymore
Don't think about it, just give me one more night
And I'll give you what you're missing, baby (Ra-Rauw)


[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro & Bad Bunny]
And if we hook up again, who cares? (Yah!)
This is our business when the urge hits (Wouh)
Our folders are full of videos of us doing it
I've got her bouncing in a split (Yee)
She likes explicit lyrics (Ah!)
You always end up here
My wild girl, and I'm the one who calms you down
I know you won't stop 'til you get what you want (No, oh-oh)
She's fired up, wants me to burn with her (Wants me to burn with her)
I'm already thinking of making a couple of kids with you (Ha)
Damn, what a body you have (Woo; yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)


[Verse 2: Bad Bunny & Rauw Alejandro]
Baby, don't act like you don't know what's gonna happen
If I don't pull out, you're gonna have to bottle me up
You know who's got it, I know how you like it
Imagine if we made a baby with our genes, but for now, she doesn't want to
She prefers it in her mouth and took a shot of my DNA
Such a quiet girl, but in bed she never stops (Yee)
Sweaty, bouncing, shining like my chains
Da-da-dance, girl (Yah!)
She looks at me and grabs it, she knows what it's for
This night is too good
The club is packed, but


[Chorus: Bad Bunny & Rauw Alejandro]
What would happen if it were just us?
In a bed, you and I fucking
Like how I used to give it to you, your friend's already gone
Why are you complaining? You're missing something, eh-eh, eh-eh (Yah!)


[Post-Chorus: Bad Bunny & Rauw Alejandro]
I've got it, girl, I've got it, baby
I've got it and I'll give it to you tonight (Yee!)
Her song is playing, her song is playing
You see her, but nobody knows her (Yee!)
Don't think about it anymore, don't think about it anymore
Don't think about it, just give me one more night
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh, mm

Tell me, MAG, turn it up
Tell me, MAG, turn it up

Karol G
[Intro]
What's up?
We're feeling great
The summer has started
Fire


[Chorus]
What would have been
If I had known you before?
Surely you would be dancing this with me
Not as friends


[Post-Chorus]
But as another thing
You nearby makes me dangerous
For a little kiss, I'll do anything
His girlfriend makes me jealous, and although she's pretty
Hey!


[Pre-Chorus]
She's not gonna treat you like me
She's not gonna kiss you like me
She's not as sexy as me
She's shy and I'm not
With these desires that I have
I might dare to get with both of you
Today you're hanging out with her
But (Mm), later maybe not
[Chorus]
What would have been
If I had known you before?
Surely you would be dancing this with me
Not as friends, hey
What would have been
If I would have known you before?
Surely you would be dancing this with me
Not as friends, hey!


[Verse]
And I see you and I don't know how to act
Baby, to conquer you, they need to pass me the manual
I hope that whatever happens, I'm not gonna give up on you
I have faith that those eyes one day are going to look at me
I'd marry you
My name sounds good with your last name
I'm waiting for the first mistake
To present you as my husband
I'd marry you
My name sounds good with your last name
I'm waiting for the first mistake
To present you as my husband
You haven't understood that


[Pre-Chorus]
She's not gonna treat you like me
She's not gonna kiss you like me
She's not as sexy as me
She's shy and I'm not
With these desires that I have
I might dare to get with both of you
Today you're hanging out with her
But (Mm), later maybe not
[Chorus]
What would have been
If I had known you before? (Hey, how?)
Surely you would be dancing this with me
Not as friends, no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey
What would have been
If I had known you before?
What would have been
If I had known you before?

Quevedo ft. Pitbull
[Intro: Pitbull]
Mommy, what the two of us do, no one knows.
We eat each other like two animals
Quevedo, sing to him


[Verse 1: Quevedo]
Really, here, baby? If they're watching us
It's normal that your friend is always scolding you
You sneak out at night and I'm always acting soft
She's 'cae' and in my house she ends up hyperventilating
Tell me where you came from, I've never seen you before
He calls me when he should be at college
If you tell me your name, please, tell me the truth
Even if I don't learn it, I swear I'll dissemble it
As many times as it takes and I call you “my love” or “baby”.
And as long as I see those buttocks (Eh-eh)
Again, I'll come if you call me
Send ubi any time I'll sneak into your bed
Ah-ah (Ah-ah)


[Chorus: Quevedo]
When no one sees us, I'm your other half
And when I'm at your feet you don't call again
And while it lasts, boyfriend and girlfriend only when we're in the dark
And though I always want more
When no one sees us, I'm your other half
And when I'm at your feet you don't call again
And while it lasts, sweethearts only when we're in the dark
And though I always want more


[Verse 2: Pitbull]
(Woo) She's looking at me, she's looking at me
And I can see it in her eyes, I can feel it in her vibe, that she wanna be mine (That she wanna be mine)
I can see it in her eyes, I can feel it in her vibe, that she wanna be mine (That she wanna be mine)
She sees I have moves, she sees what I do, but love is planned (Love is planned)
Everything has its time and everything has its timing, is all about timing (Is all about timing)
You do your thing, I do mine, let's keep it real (Let's keep it real)
We're cool, we do it all, but we're friends (We're friends)
When no one sees us we go from Miami to Madrid in the jett
We ate the three of us, hahaha, you know what it is, dale
Woo


[Bridge: Pitbull & Quevedo]
Mami, what the two of us do, nobody knows (Yeah, oh-oh)
We eat each other like two animals (Yeah)
Again, I'll come if you call me
Send ubi any time I'll sneak into your bed
Ah-ah


[Chorus: Quevedo]
When no one sees us, I'm your other half
And when I'm at your feet you don't call again
And while it lasts, boyfriend and girlfriend only when we're in the dark
And though I always want more
When no one sees us, I'm your other half (Ah-ah)
And when I'm at your feet you don't call again
And while it lasts (While it lasts)
Boyfriends only when we're in the dark
And though I always want more

[Chorus]
For love no one dies, no one

And we form the degenerate, yeah


[Post-Chorus]
Cause I know by your face that you want me to
I know what you look like
You've got a man too many

Taba looking for a girl like you, you, you, you
Whose turn is it? Let's play heads or tails
She ain't shy, she's the crowd-tud-tud
Yeah, rosita pa' la baby and all her crew
People watching and she's out of line
Makeup took off, she's got a fan club
Cartier glasses or else Jean Paul glasses
All the sporty cars with the R sport


[Bridge]
She snored at me
And she ended up calling me, telling me that she got juiced
To' get out she lied to him
She said she wasn't in the mood, how rich, mommy, she felt

I can tell by your face that you want me to
I know well how you are
You've got a man too many
You like women too

Iguales
Quevedo
[Intro]
And I wasn't going to come out, I promise, nor did I want to.
I was almost forced to, so it's not my fault.
It could've been someone else, but it was just you that day
And I didn't think I'd get your hopes up
But, ma, sorry, sorry
I'm a dog, I'm always on the hunt
And the only thing I remember is that I called you 'Lucia' or Maria
Well, I don't know, I didn't know
Your friend was right when she said:


[Chorus]
“Baby, no, hey, hey, hey, no, hey, that's gonna go wrong”
So, mommy, no, hey, hey, no, hey, you mustn't trust me
All us men are the same (Oh)
We just wanna ride in a McLaren (Oh)
Money, women and abdominale' (Oh)
I know it hurts, but, baby, it's the truth


[Verse]
I promised mommy a grandchild, sorry, mommy (Sorry)
No me fío, ya no chingo, solo me lo maman (They just blow me)
I like the ones from La Feria and also the ones from Tama
And the ones from Añaza I'm taking them to Abama
Mommy, I'm about to move to Paris (-ís), on the island I've already given it all to' (To')
I don't want to know your history, I already know that my friend gave it to you (Uh)
And I don't mind sharing, if you want me to give it to you between the do' (Do')
Mami, I know that you're religious, throw it away with God's forgiveness (Ma)
Mommy, I don't know how to talk about anything else (No), baby, that's not my role.
Sorry, I'm just whimsical (Haha), baby, I'm bluffing
Addicted to where the sun don't shine, pa' chingar I don't have no self-control
That's why when I sleep with someone else, the next day I take you out to the mall
But I hate to be such a troublemaker
But don't panic, no one knows about it, don't panic.
That this will be fixed quickly
Tomorrow to buy him an attic
I don't even know what I'm saying, I don't understand myself, ma, don't mind me
I'm just a fucking heterobasic


[Chorus]
“Baby, no, hey, hey, no, hey, that's gonna go wrong (No, oh-oh)
So, mommy, no, hey, hey, no, hey, you mustn't trust me
All men are the same (Oh)
We just wanna ride in a McLaren (Oh)
Money, women and abominale' (Oh)
I know it hurts, but, baby, it's the truth


[Outro]
Don't blame you, daddy was like that too
Don't blame you, daddy was like that too
All men are just the same
Don't blame you, daddy was like that too
I didn't blame you, Daddy was like that too
All men are just alike
We just wanna ride in a McLaren
Money, women and abdominale'.
Don't blame you, Daddy was like that too
Don't blame you, daddy was like that too

Rauw Alejandro ft. Romeo Santos
[Intro: Rauw Alejandro]
I wrote you how I felt and I erased it.
I told you I didn't love you and I screwed it up
Knowing that
When you were leaving, I just wanted to kiss you
I remember when I left your house
I said “no” wanting to say “yes”.
But I felt your doubt and it brought me doubt
That's why we're here


[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro]
You tell me why and I tell you that
If we're nothing, then what are we playing for?
Are we playing? Time is flying by
And you without me I don't know if you're having a good time
You tell me what for and I tell you that
Why are we lying to each other? If deep down inside you know
You can see so much that it's killing you
To say that now without me you're having a better time


[Verse 1: Romeo Santos]
I fronted up and I played hard to get and I got a crush
You wanting to be my friend and I kissed you
You know very well
That we can't control our feelings
And I call others to forget about you
But in my mind I have you on repeat
More than a hotness, baby, you dissemble
That's why we're here


[Chorus: Romeo Santos]
You tell me why and I tell you that
If we ain't nothing, then what are we playing for?
Are we playing? Time is flying by
And you without me I don't know if you're having a good time
You tell me what's the use and I tell you that
Why are we lying to each other? If deep down inside you know
You can see so much that it's killing you
To say that now you're having a better time without me


[Verse 2: Romeo Santos & Rauw Alejandro].
Rauw
What's the name of this game we're both playing?
With the hypocrisy that we wear the mask they can believe us
You knew that I love you
I tell you “give me a band”, but I'm burning inside
When I'm in ugly blunt
I call you and I stay mute


[Bridge: Rauw Alejandro]
Stay
Where are you going? Come, where are you going?
What-ay, stay
Where you going?


[Chorus: Romeo Santos]
You tell me what for and I tell you that
Why are we lying to each other? If deep down inside
You can tell so much that it's killing you
To say that now it's better without me you're having a good time




[Interlude: Rauw Alejandro & Romeo Santos] [Interlude: Rauw Alejandro & Romeo Santos]
You tell me what's the matter
And I tell you that, and I tell you that, so what?
You tell me what for
And you without me I don't know if you're having a good time
Mami
It's Raul Alejandro with The King Romeo, haha (The biggest)
And I don't know what you and I have, but I want you to know that it's special


[Outro: Rauw Alejandro]
I wrote you how I felt and I erased it
I told you I didn't love you and I ruined it
Knowing that

[Pre-Chorus]
Wet flow Nile when I touch it, that totito always smells like coconut
I bite it, I spit on it, it's hot like a hot dog
She's a whore in the bedroom, we do it but it's always without a condom
I nail her like I nail the Glock, like a stripper she models in my salon


[Chorus]
And she screams “ah-ah-ah-ah-ah”
When I do it to her, she says don't stop and I give her another ve', eh-eh-eh
Like a porno movie, if she gets hot she looks like a star
She trеpa on me, I make her come, I give her like e', eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
I give it to her like e', eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
And he hollers “ah-ah-ah-ah-ah”
When I do it to her, she says don't stop and I give her another ve', eh-eh-eh-eh.
Like a porn movie, if she gets horny she looks like a star.
She climbs on top of me, I make her come, I know how e', eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
I know how to e', eh-eh-eh-eh-eh


[Verse]
She looks like a star, she's getting naughty
Tell me where you are, you'll get him over here
She always gives it to me, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cause I take it out (I take it out) and nobody takes it out (I take it out)
I bought him some taco' (Taco'), find me a paca (Paca)
We'll do it just after sunrise
With two perco's I took the pain away
We fit like a Glock to the drum
Young Gypsy, my nigga, my friend's stick to me
They look for the opportunity wanting a belly (A belly)
I don't stick it to him even if he follows me on Instagram (He follows me)
He knows that I kill him, that ass is out of league
Nobody sees what we're doin' on a short leash (A short leash)
I sing to her while she hands me her virtu' (Me give her virtu')
I blow her, she smokes the Backwood (Backwood)
That toto on top does voodoo


[Pre-Chorus]
Wet flow Nile when I touch it, that totito always smells like coconut
I bite it, I spit on it, it's hot like a hot dog
She's a whore in the bedroom, we do it but it's always without a condom
I nail her like I nail the Glock, like a stripper she models in my salon


[Chorus]
And she screams “ah-ah-ah-ah-ah”
When I do it to her, she says don't stop and I give her another ve', eh-eh-eh
Like a porno movie, if she gets horny she looks like a star (She looks like a star)
She climbs on top of me, I make her come, I give her like e', eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
I give it to her like e', eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
And he yells “ah-ah-ah-ah-ah”
When I do it to her, she says don't stop and I give her another ve', eh-eh-eh-eh
Like a porn movie, if she gets horny she looks like a star.
She climbs on top of me, I make her come, I know how e', eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
I know how to e', eh-eh-eh-eh-eh

Halo 
Quevedo ft. La Pantera
[Intro: Quevedo]
When I met you
You were single, you went out with anyone
Anybody with a full wallet and a chain on the outside
But now all that's not so
She's not single anymore, now she's got a kitten and when he doesn't know about it
He comes to see me at the show so that I'll see her
And I know that if he sees me there's gonna be a shootout, but


[Refrain: Quevedo]
Your little boyfriend can get rid of the bad guille 'e malo
Ask him why he unfollowed me, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
He knows that from time to time I install it for you
And don't let him get rough with me, here the bullets are hollow, prr-prr
Tell him to take off the bad guille 'e malo
Ask him why he unfollowed me, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
He knows that from time to time I'll set it up for you
And don't let him get rough with me, here the bullets are hollow, prr-prr


[Verse 1: The Panther]
I'll park the G-Wagon Brabus
Al la'o de tu jevo “el gángster” y no se le veja tan malo.
The hollow bullets, oh-oh, the expensive outfits, oh-oh
You're for a singer, ma, talkin' straight to you, oh-oh
Kiss me just in case I get shot, plo-plo-plo
I bought my first Glock to take care of you, yeah
In my VIP there's always you and the CÎROC
Tell that sucker to stop looking where there's no need to look
If he gets confused answer the .45, brr!
If he wants war, war is what it is (Mmm), yeah
I'm in my prime, I'm on my prime
I'll air it out for you, I swear on my mai


[Refrain: La Pantera & Quevedo]
So tell that fool not to look at me funny
And ask him why he unfollowed me, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
You know that from time to time I'll install it for you.
And don't let me get rough, because here the bullets are hollow, prr-prr
Your little boyfriend can take off the bad guille 'e malo
Ask him why he unfollowed me, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
He knows that from time to time I'll install it for you
And don't let him get rough with me, here the bullets are hollow, prr-prr
Tell him to take off the bad guille 'e malo
Ask him why he unfollowed me, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
He knows that from time to time I'll set it up for you
And don't let him get rough with me, here the bullets are hollow, prr-prra, ja


[Verse 2: Quevedo]
I ain't no malean, I ain't got no gun or nothin' like that
But I eat that pussy, I don't eat that tolete that's vegetarian
The bobo's sapeando, that's a guard
And if that motherfucker gets in, he goes home in his sandals
Mommy, tell me which way you want me to enter
And if it's from the front, just make yourself comfortable
Just make yourself comfortable, I'm giving it to you
Every posh girl needs a bad boy
And I'm not bad myself, but I have a stick
And if he opens his mouth, he'll leave you a gift
That ass is big, that's not human
I gotta use both hands to get a good grip on it
That pussy is clean, it's got me eating healthy
Bad Gyal, in the toto always carries a gram, prr-prr-prr
Get silly and we'll find you
And we're different by the gold' in the neck like the Vatican, ma




[Refrain: Quevedo]
Your little boyfriend can get rid of the bad guille 'e malo
Ask him why he unfollowed me, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
He knows that from time to time I install it for you


And don't let him get rough with me, because here the bullets are hollow, prr-prr
Tell him to take off his bad guille 'e malo
Ask him why he unfollowed me, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
He knows that from time to time I'll set it up for you
And don't let him get rough with me, that here the bullets are hollow, prr-prr


[Outro: Quevedo]
The bullets are hollow, the ba-the bullets are hollow
Bullets are hollow, bullets are hollow, bullets are hollow, bullets are hollow.
Bullets are hollow, bullets are hollow, bullets are hollow.
Bullets are hollow, bullets are hollow, bullets are-
Prr-prr

Duro de verdad pt. 2
Los sufridos ft. Bad Gyal
[Intro: Los Sufridos & Bad Gyal]
Bad Gyal (Bad Gyal)
Suffered!
Hey, hey


[Pre-Chorus: Bad Gyal, Los Sufridos]
Pa' tu infierno fui demasiado demonia (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
It wasn't like you thought it would be, I didn't do so bad
Now I've got more time to do chorus with the guys
I go hard on the weekends
I'm not in mourning, the crazy lady's out of line
I activated all the chulito' I had in the line-up


[Chorus: Los Sufridos, Bad Gyal, Los Sufridos & Bad Gyal].
Not that you're a jail for me to be making time for you
You're really hard at it (Aha)
Dando banda, yo tengo un super talento (I've got a super talent)
I go real hard, ah-ah-ah (Mmm)
I walk real hard, ah-ah-ah (Mmm)
I walk real hard, ah-ah-ah


[Bridge: Los Sufridos, Bad Gyal]
Step on it, step on it
Again, Bad Gyal


[Verse 1: Bad Gyal]
I'm not gonna deny, sometimes I remember
How we used to do it looking in the mirror
I've got a few to forget the urge
I drink with the' baby', I'm back to smoking weed (Again')
What's holding me back I learned that I don't like it
And I don't think it's my fault anymore
What's between us is behind me, I've changed my route
It lasts less than the coal in a hookah


[Verse 2: The Suffered Ones]
I'm chuky in a movie and it's called “no me apecho”.
No chance, I bend it and I go straight ahead
I'm anesthetized, I don't feel no more
I ride in my car, I don't go in feeling
You were living it up in Hollywood
Are you in pain? Join me in a Vick VapoRub
Manita, put that down, I already gave you your light
(Join a Vick VapoRub)


[Pre-Chorus: Bad Gyal & Los Sufridos].
Pa' tu infierno fui demasiado demonia (Hey, hey, hey)
It wasn't like you thought it would be, I haven't done so bad
Now I've got more time to do chorus with the guys
I go hard on the weekends
I'm not in mourning, the crazy lady's out of line
I turned on all the pimps I had in the line-up




[Chorus: Bad Gyal, Los Sufridos & Bad Gyal].
Not that you're a jail for me to be doing you time
I've got a real hard time (Aha)
I've got a super-talent (I've got a super-talent)
I go real hard, ah-ah-ah
I'm walking real hard, ah-ah-ah
I walk real hard, ah-ah-ah


[Outro: Los Sufridos & Bad Gyal]
Suffered!

Take you for a ride with me
But you tell me only the ugly ones
Hey


[Verse 1]
I want to take you for a ride
But she tells me only the ugly ones
If you know that I don't drool
But I can see the desire in your face (No)
She doesn't have any pictures in stories
Cause she ain't got no social networks either
He says that we're not alike
He accuses me that I must learn social networking
But that one knows, I am bandit
He says my worth doesn't scare him
He likes me because I've got a way to go
And my enemies all get frustrated
They never see me, you don't see the submarine
Underwater the bullets don't listen
I've got infighting, a thousand fights
You don't ask me what's in my piggy bank


[Refrain]
Moon, tell me that you surely see her
If you think me a little in the night
Or is it just me that's upside down
Hey, moon, 'cause-because-because I don't know anymore
I bought a ticket and I missed my turn, it went by and I didn't remember it
Moon, tell me you're sure to see her
If you think me a little in the night
Or is it just me that's upside down
Hey, moon, 'cause-because-because I don't know anymore
I bought a ticket and I missed my turn, it went by and I didn't remember it


[Verse 2]
I'm not for you, you call me a nuisance!
I lie alone talking to monster
Sometimes, mommy, your bed is an oven
I'm not happy or I've lost your morbidity
And that he has others, I know that
He gets his cache down fast
Lonely, I think I'm Che
Love, anime story, yeah


[Pre-Chorus]
Dance, dance me, dance me, like you are little'.
Dance, dance me, dance me, I kissed him on the mouth
Dance, dance me, like you are little'.
Dance, dance me, I kissed him on the mouth




[Chorus]
Moon, tell me that surely you see her
If you think of me a little in the night
Or is it just me that's upside down
Hey, moon, because-because-because I don't know anymore
I bought a ticket and I missed my turn, it went by and I didn't remember (Fuck)
Moon, tell me that for sure you see her
If you think me a little at night
Or is it just me that's upside down
Hey, moon, 'cause-because-because I don't know anymore
I bought a ticket and I missed my turn, it went by and I didn't remember (Yo, yo)


[Outro]
I want to take you for a ride
But she tells me only the ugly ones (Woah, woah)
If you know for a fact that I don't drool
But I can see the desire in your face (Woah, woah)
You don't have any pictures in stories
Cause you ain't got no social networks either (Woah, woah)
He says that we're not alike
He tells me that I should learn sociale' (Woah, woah)

Los Días Contados
Quevedo ft Rels B


[Verse 1: Rels B]
Free, I feel so free when you're there and you talk to me.
What would become of me if you go away?
I don't know if you think of me when you're alone, if you'd have my back
The rules are there to be broken
And though you might be scared of what you feel with me
This life that I lead is so weird, but how nice if you'd stay


[Chorus: Rels B]
I'd like to know if you're looking out for me
I think of you all the time, baby, I haven't forgotten you
Time goes by and I'm still so dependent on you
I'm thinking of you all the time, I'm counting the days
To see you again


[Verse 2: Quevedo]
When you're alone, does my name come to you or does it only happen to me?
Mommy, heh, I'm all alone at home
Mommy, tell me, why doesn't it happen to you? Hey
That I put on Netflix to hide it
Then we'll fuck and you'll sleep over
And tomorrow you don't go to work and you sleep over again
And every day it's the same, I want you to be my routine
I'll even take you out of the gym, I'll do the cardio on top of you, heh
Really? Mommy, I didn't want anything serious
That a lot of people throw me away, it's no mystery
But it's gonna take a millennium for me to see an ass like that again.
Mommy, I have no middle ground
You know I'm the best he gave you


[Bridge: Rels B & Quevedo]
And though everyone comments when I'm near you
There the only truth is what I make you feel
No that makes you doubt, and why lie?
Leave it in the middle if you can go on, if you can go on
[Refrain: Quevedo]
I'd like to know if you're watching over me
I think about you all the time, mommy, I haven't forgotten you
Time goes by and I'm still so aware of you
You've got me crazy, I live out of control


[Outro: Quevedo]
I go on and on, mommy

Sebastián Yatra ft. Bad Gyal
[Intro: Bad Gyal]
It's 2 o'clock in the morning and I don't know where you are
Baby, let's stop all this drama, I don't want anybody else
And even though I'd already deleted your cell phone
Now that I started drinking I wanna see you (I wanna see you)
I want to call you, I want to call you (Ah)


[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra & Bad Gyal].
It's 2 o'clock in the morning and I don't know where you are
Baby, let's stop all this drama, I don't want anybody else
And even though I'd already deleted your cell phone
Now that I started drinking I want to see you
I wanna call you, I wanna call you


[Verse 1: Sebastian Yatra]
Hello baby, how's it going? Your memory won't go away
Tell me if it's just to talk, or if I'm picking you up
To throw the seats back
For us to fog up the windows
So you can tell me that you'll stay
And that you won't forget my number
To throw the seats back
So we'll fog up the windows
So you can tell me that you're staying
And that you won't forget my number


[Refrain: Sebastián Yatra & Bad Gyal]
It's 2 o'clock in the morning and I don't know where you are
Baby, let's stop all this drama, I don't want anyone else
And even though I'd already deleted your cell phone
Now that I started drinking I want to see you
I wanna call you, I wanna call you
[Verse 2: Bad Gyal]
No more tequila (Ay)
Under the effects I wanna call you (Yeah)
To get on top of me (Ah)
Remind you that there's no one like me (Rico)
You found yourself a hot babe and you got bored already (Aha)
Even though her family don't love me, she likes her bandit (Hey)
Baby, forget what they think, complicity I make it good for you
The basics don't understand you (No)
With me you give one hundred percent (With me you give one hundred percent; ay)


[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra & Bad Gyal, Bad Gyal].
It's 2 o'clock in the morning and I don't know where you are
Baby, let's stop all this drama, I don't want nobody else
And even though I'd already deleted your cell phone
Now that I've started drinking I wanna see you
I want to call you, I want to call you (Eh)


[Interlude: Sebastián Yatra, Sebastián Yatra & Bad Gyal].
And that damn desire to see you, uh-oh-oh
I can't even kiss you, uh-oh-oh
How long does it have to be?
How long does it have to hurt?
For you to call me back or for you to be mine completely




[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra & Bad Gyal, Bad Gyal].
It's 2 o'clock in the morning and I don't know where you are
Baby, let's stop all this drama, I don't want nobody else
And even though I'd already deleted your cell phone
Now that I've started drinking I wanna see you (I wanna see you)
I wanna call you, I wanna call you


[Outro: Bad Gyal & Sebastián Yatra]
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-ah
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-ah
Ya-ya-ya-ya-
Bad Gyal, the skinny one you like
Hm, ah, the skinny one you like

Se Fue
Rauw Alejandro ft. Laura Pausini
[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro & Laura Pausini, Both]
She's not answering the phone anymore
My hope's hanging by a thread
I never thought I could lose my mind like that
Because of her (Because of him)
Why did she suddenly stop loving me?
Why did my life turn so empty?
Nobody's answering my questions because there's nothing left for me
Without her (Without him)


[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro, Rauw Alejandro & Laura Pausini]
She left, she left, the scent of her hair left
She left, her whisper of silеnce left
She lеft, her fairy-tale smile left
She left, the sweet honey I tasted on her lips left
She left, and only her poison remains
She left, and my love turned to ice
She left, and my life left with her
She left, and since then, all I have are tears


[Verse 2: Laura Pausini]
Chained to nights of madness
I would even go to jail with him
A whole life is not enough
Without him
In my summer the sun no longer rises
With his storm, he destroyed everything
Breaking into a thousand pieces those dreams that we built
Yesterday


[Chorus: Laura Pausini]
He left, he left, only his poison remains
He left and my love turned to ice
He left, and my life left with him
He left and I don't know why


[Verse 3: Rauw Alejandro & Laura Pausini]
If God exists, he must remember me
Although I know that between Him and me, there are only dark clouds in the sky
I will beg Him, I will pray to Him, I swear, I will find Him
So that he can take away this pain that she has left me
In this dark, absurd life without him
I feel that he has become the center and end of my entire universe
If love has limits, I would go through them for him
And in the immense emptiness of my nights, I feel him


[Bridge: Laura Pausini]
I will love him
Like I loved him the first time
Because one kiss from him was a lifetime
Feeling how I'd lose myself for him


[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro & Laura Pausini, Both]
She left, she left, the scent of her hair left
He left, his whisper of silence left
She left, her fairy-tale smile left (She left)
She left, the sweet honey I tasted on her lips left (He left)
She left, and only her poison remains (Ah)
She left, and my love turned to ice (Oh)
She left, and my life left with her
She left and I don't know why




[Outro: Laura Pausini & Rauw Alejandro, Both]
She left, she left
And I don't know why
She left, she left
And I don't know why
She left, she left
Oh, oh-oh
It left, it left, the sweet honey I tasted on her lips, oh-oh
And only her poison remains
And my love turned to ice (Oh-oh)
She left, she left
She left, she left, and since then, all I have are tears
And she left

[Intro: Danny Ocean]
Ba-Ba-Babylon girl, ba-ba-babylon girl, ba-ba-babylon girl, ba-ba-babylon girl


[Pre-Chorus: Kapo]
Picture yourself on the beach the do'
You won't have to compete with none
I'd repeat all your voice notes
But now, look, I got you here


[Chorus: Kapo]
And when I see you again, I want us to patch up in Altoque
That there's you and me, that we'll be in another and that nothing will matter
And know that you're mine, life is as fresh as your cleavage
We're going to Cali, we'll dance salsa all night long


[Verse 1: Danny Ocean & Kapo].
There's a beach, there's only you and me
I'm your visa if you wanna come
You're a mixture of sand and sunshine
The prettiest one I've ever seen like that out there
You're a mix of sand with sun, sand with sun and breeze
You're what it takes for a happy life


[Refrain: Danny Ocean]
When I can come back, I'd like to take you to Los Roques.
Mami, I have a pana who's going to square the boat for us, and
I want you to know my seas, your sky and all its colors.
I want to kiss you, kiss you, kiss you and dance all night long, oh


[Bridge: Kapo & Danny Ocean]
Oh, like a madman, with my mind I'll make her
You my babylon girl, your angelic smile, that's what I swallowed
And like a madman, with my mind I made you manifest
A Cali baby girl, almost caribbean girl, golden in her skin
[Verse 2: Kapo & Danny Ocean].
Oh, annihilated, from afar you can see him
Vara más como dirá, par de besos me trae
It's not normal what he transmits to me
Seeing him in the eyes makes me levitate
Yeah, and you can feel it, ma, you can feel it
Your energy, mommy, he's got it clear
And me, it feels good, it feels
I'll take you when they change the president


[Chorus: Kapo]
And when I see you again, I want to patch us up in the Altoque
You and me, we'll be in another one and nothing will matter
And know that you're mine, life is as fresh as your cleavage
We'll go to Cali, we'll dance salsa all night long


[Refrain: Danny Ocean]
When I can come back, I'd like to take you to Los Roques
Mami, I've got a friend who's gonna fix the boat for us
I want him to know my seas, its skies and all its colors
I want to kiss you, kiss you, kiss you and dance the night away




[Outro: Danny Ocean]
Are you going with Kapo, are you going to Cali tonight?
Or are you leaving with me, are you leaving with Danny for Los Roques?

[Intro]
Hahaha
Maluma, ba-ba-baby


[Pre-Chorus]
I saw you at the disco dancing with someone else
But they played the song that was ours
You looked at me in the eyes, you laughed
With that you say everything to me
I thought you forgot me because you didn't come back


[Chorus]
It seems the girl hasn't forgotten me, she's still keeping tabs
She tried to ignore me, but the tension is there, it's real
If you ask her if she's over me and she says yes, she's lying
It's no secrеt that between her and me, things wеre left unresolved
It seems the girl hasn't forgotten me, she's still keeping tabs
She tried to ignore me, but the tension is there, it's real
If you ask her if she's over me and she says yes, she's lying
It's no secret that between her and me, things were left unresolved


[Verse]
Things were left unresolved, a night, a romantic dinner (Yeah)
Why do you see me differently? In front of people you act unfriendly (Ah)
You want to look like the good one, mami
You know that's still for me
Looking at pictures, I fell into yours
And I'm not denying you, I gave myself a little love (I gave myself)
I don't know why you tried with the next one
If you're not ready to surpass me
The mark I left on you is still permanent
Like a tattoo, nothing can erase it now
Could it be that you miss me, baby?
He doesn't fill you with anything
You forgot me I swore


[Chorus]
It seems the girl hasn't forgotten me, she's still keeping tabs
She tried to ignore me, but the tension is there, it's real
If you ask her if she's over me and she says yes, she's lying
It's no secret that between her and me, things were left unresolved

Haha
Alright, alright, alright, alright

Shakira
[Intro: Shakira]
Shaka!
I went out to clear my mind
And I got tired of being turned off, decided to turn myself on
I changed my friends 'cause the ones I had only talked about him
I had to learn the hard way that I have nothing to lose
And just like them


[Chorus: Shakira]
I also have the right to be bad in order to have a good time
I'm free now, and I can do whatever I want
Being single is great
I have the right to be bad in order to have a good time
I'm free now, and I can do whatever I want
Being single is great, ah (Shaka)


[Verse 1: Shakira]
Thе day is for partying, the beach
And for crossing the linе (Ah)
On the sand, on the towel (Ah)
That little plan never fails
This girl has fans
And a broken heart like Alejandro Sanz (Ah-ah)
There are many who hit on me
But few who give it to me
I'm selective, little experience
Normal, for obvious reasons
I developed a phobia of love
Any fuckboy who messages me gets a screenshot for his girlfriend
[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
No one will tell me how I should behave
They can give their opinions


[Chorus: Shakira]
But I have the right to be bad in order to have a good time
I'm free now, and I can do whatever I want
Being single is great
I have the right to be bad in order to have a good time
I'm free now, and I can do whatever I want
Being single is great, ah


[Verse 2: Shakira]
I reserved the hotel with an ocean view
I'm already turned up after just one cocktail
I put on little clothes to show my skin
The queen bee is dripping honey


[Refrain: Shakira]
It still smells like summer here
What's wrong with that?
It's meant to be used and
My body is saying


[Chorus: Shakira]
I have the right to be bad in order to have a good time (Shaka!)
I'm free now, and I can do whatever I want
Being single is great, ah, ah, ah
[Refrain: Shakira]
It still smells like summer here
What's wrong with that?
It's meant to be used and
My body is saying
It still smells like summer here
And it's meant to be used, oh yes
Today, I'm getting something here
Oh! (Shaka)


[Outro: Shakira, Anitta, Danna Paola & Lele Pons, Both]
Oh-oh-oh, being single is great
And now the she-wolves
I have the right to be bad in order to have a good time
I'm free now, and I can do whatever I want
Oh, how nice
Being single is great
Look how nice
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I have the right to be bad in order to have a good time
I'm free now, and I can do whatever I want
Being single is great
Ooh-ooh
I have the right to be bad in order to have a good time
So that that jerk feels pain when he sees me
Being single is great
I have the right to be bad in order to have a good time
So that that jerk feels pain when he sees me


Being single is great

Oh-na-na, oh-na-na
Oh, baby


[Verse 1]
Oh, here I am (Here I am)
Parked in the same place where I met you (Where I met you)
Everything that plays on the radio reminds me of you
You there and me here
And I don't know if I can, but I keep going


[Pre-Chorus]
I keep thinking about your mouth, I lock myself in four walls
You won't find such a beautiful story these days
And I'm so crazy, so crazy, I keep thinking of your dance
Look at the moon and feel that I'm whispering in your ear


[Chorus]
Oh-na-na, oh-na-na, oh-na-na-eh
Oh-na-na, oh-na-na
Such a beautiful story
You won't find such a beautiful story these days
Oh-na-na, oh-na-na, oh-na-na-eh
Oh-na-na, oh-na-na
Look at the moon and feel that I'm whispering in your ear


[Verse 2]
Oh, with a rose I conquered her
While dancing dancehall I took her away
And without a breeze, I got her wet
Without touching her, I undressed her
Very beautiful, she knows it well
And every day I let her know
That she's got me crazy with that back-and-forth
And I keep going


[Pre-Chorus]
I keep thinking about your mouth, I lock myself in four walls
You won't find such a beautiful story these days
And I'm so crazy, so crazy, I keep thinking of your dance
Look at the moon and feel that I'm whispering in your ear


[Chorus]
Oh-na-na, oh-na-na, oh-na-na-eh
Oh-na-na, oh-na-na
Such a beautiful story
You won't find such a beautiful story these days
Oh-na-na, oh-na-na, oh-na-na-eh
Oh-na-na, oh-na-na
(Look at the moon and feel that I'm whispering in your ear)
You won't find such a beautiful story these days
[Outro]
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
Yo, Gangsta
(Oh-na-na)
Won't find it these days
(Feel that I'm whispering in your ear)
(Oh-na-na, oh-na-na)
You won't find such a beautiful story these days
(Look at the moon and feel that I'm whispering in your ear)
