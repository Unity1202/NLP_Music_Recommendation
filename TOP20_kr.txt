Who
Jimin
[Chorus]
We never met, but she's all I see at night


Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?


[Verse 1]
If every day I think about her
Yeah, every day of my life
Then tell me why I haven't found her


(Why, why, why, why, why?)


[Pre-Chorus]
There's so many people to see (There's so many people to see)
And places to go (There's so many places to go)
I still haven't found your love




[Chorus]
We nevеr met, but she's all I see at night
Nevеr met, but she's always on my mind


Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?


[Verse 2]
I'll take her places they ain't found yet
I'll put it all on the line


I'll be that someone she can count on
One, two, three, four, five


[Pre-Chorus]
There's so many people to see (There's so many people to see)
And places to go (There's so many places to go)
I still haven't found your love


[Chorus]
We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
Is she someone that I see every day?
Is she somewhere a thousand miles away?


Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?


[Bridge]
(Who is my heart) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my heart) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my heart) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my—) Who is my heart waiting for?


[Chorus]
We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
Is she someone that I see every day?
Is she somewhere a thousand miles away?
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?

If I'm tryna be special
Can I get closer to you?
I can feel my heart pounding
When your fingertips graze past me
If I'm tryna be special
So that I can sing while making eye contact with you
I'll show you, baby
Oh, I didn't realize
Oh, I didn't think I'd care
Oh my gosh, now I
Won't hide
You are the light in my darkness
Like the sunshine vibe
It spreads quietly


[Chorus]
That I want a real good love, good love, good love
I'm tryna find a love, good love, real love
I was in pitch black, but I couldn't stop thinking of you all day long
I want to take one step and two steps closer without you knowing
Stay with you, with you, with you, with you
I will be your reason, rеason, reason, reason
I hope this feeling rеaches you, to you, you
To you

The wind passing by
Floating petals
It feels like it's been waiting just for us
When that door opens
When I get closer to you
I'll tell you this
I will be special all for you
Special just for you
For you (For you)
For you (For you)
I wanna be with you

[Intro: Jung Kook]
One, two, 3D


[Verse 1: Jung Kook]
I can't touch you through the phone
Or kiss you through the universe
In another time zone
It's the only time I can't reverse
But when there's two dimensions
There's only one I'm missin'
And if you feel alone
You don't have to feel that no more


[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh-uh


[Chorus: Jung Kook]
So if you're ready (So if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Uh-uh)
You won't regret me (You won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (Champagnе confetti)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D


[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook]
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (Girl)
3D (Woo)
You know how I likе it, girl (Girl)
3D (Woo)


[Verse 2: Jung Kook]
Body to body to body to body to body
You and me, baby, you know that we got it
So don't go gettin' me started
'Cause you know I get hot-hearted
Baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, you makin' me crazy
Rain, rain, rain, you can't fake it
You give me brand-new emotion
You got me drinkin' that potion


[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh-uh


[Chorus: Jung Kook]
So if you're ready (So if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Hey, show me, girl, now)
You won't regret me (You won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (Champagne confetti, hey)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Come on, come on, come on)

[Verse 3: Jack Harlow]
I'm on my Jung Kook, take a chick off one look
And when they get took, they don't ever get untook (Woo)
When I seen that body, you would think it was a dead body
The way I told my boys, "Come look"
I used to take girls up to Stony Brook
And steal they hearts like some crook, true story
Now when I hold somebody's hand, it's a new story
All my ABGs get cute for me
I had one girl (One girl), too boring
Two girls (Two girls), that was cool for me
Three girls, damn, dude's horny
Four girls, okay, now you whorin'
(Hey, hey, hey) I'm loose
I done put these shrooms to good use
I done put my city on my back
And the world know my name, I'm the truth


[Chorus: Jung Kook & Jack Harlow]
So if you're ready
And if you'll let me
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Ooh)
You won't regret me (Won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (Champagne confetti)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Show it to me, girl, now; why?)


[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook & Jack Harlow]
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (How do you like it? Right)
3D (Woo)
You know how I like it, girl (Alright, alright)
3D (Woo, woo)
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (You know how I like it; Spy Kids)
3D (Alright)
You know how I like it, girl (Girl)
3D (Woo)


[Outro: Jack Harlow]
I got you playin' with yourself on camera
You my bae, just like Tampa
Speakin' of bucks, I got those
And as for fucks, well, not those
And as for thots, well, do you really wanna know? I thought so
I'll fly you from Korea to Kentucky
And you ain't gotta guarantee me nothin', I just wanna see if I get lucky
I just wanna meet you in the physical and see if you would touch me

Closer than this
Jimin
[Verse 1]
Do you also remember
The moment we first met?
We were so shy and awkward back then
Now that I look back
We've come this far in just a blink of an eye
We walked it together, alongside each other
At times, I fell and shed tears
We comforted each other, with a pat on the back
Gazing at one another with tears in our eyes
Calling out each other's names
Starting on June 13
To the us of thе present, herе and now
Even if you're not here
At the same place, always


[Pre-Chorus]
Don't have to worry now
Letting go of your hand for a moment
But it's only a small comma in our story
Just call my name out loud
Until the days tinge purple once again


[Chorus]
'Cause anytime you want me (I'll be)
Right here where you call me (I'll be)
I could never let you go
Never let you go
Whenever you need me (I'll be)
If you believe me (I'll be)
I'll never let you go
Never let you go


[Verse 2]
Whenever it rains, I'll remember the times I sang in the rain
Whenever it snows, I'll cherish how you smiled for me in the snow
On the spring day, we meet again, I'll tell you everything I couldn't before
My love, my babe, forever by your side
Seven equals one, right, our hearts still beat as one
Close your eyes for just a second, I'll be standing in front of you, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
Don't have to worry now
Letting go of your hand for a moment
But it's only a small comma in our story
Just call my name out loud
Until the days tinge purple once again


[Chorus]
'Cause anytime you want me (I'll be)
Right here where you call me (I'll be)
I could never let you go
Never let you go
Whenever you need me (I'll be)
If you believe me (I'll be)
I'll never let you go
Never let you go


[Bridge]
When I knock on your door with our hearts united as one
Open it for me with your bright smile
When the paused time begins to run again
Baby, I'll come back to you




[Chorus]
Let's sing it together, this song
For the day, we'll reunite again
I could never let you go (Never let you go)
Never let you go (Never let you go)
Let's sing it even louder, this song
So we can become one again
I will never let you go (I will never let you go; Oh-oh)
Never let you go (Oh)


[Outro]
Let's sing it together, this song (Yeah)
For the day, we'll reunite again (Yeah)
I could never let you go (I could never let you go)
Never let you go (Never let you go)
Let's sing it even louder, this song (Yeah)
So we can become one again (Yeah)
I will never let you go (I will never let you go)
Never let you go (Never let you go)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Hey, Roman numeral seven, bae, drop it like it's hot
If this world was mine, I'd take your dreams and make 'em multiply
If this world was mine, I'd take your enemies in front of God
Introduce 'em to that light, hit them strictly with that fire

In this world, concrete flowers grow
Heartache, she only doin' what she know

Haon ft. Giselle
[Chorus: HAON]
Like hold up
Wait a minute
Would you let me appulse (applause?)
I’ve arrived in front of your house
Without navigation
I’m all in when it’s you, if I throw it
Like I’m LeBron
From minutes before I arrive, my imagination is already running wild
Beep beep, I honked
Don’t even need GPS
You gon' make me happy, yeah
Even though I’m smiling, I’m serious
Winning every day, you’re my PS5
Life with you is a fiesta
Dodging all my worries
Skrr, skrr, skrr, ha


[Verse 1: HAON]
Touch down on your body like a running back
They just sit back and suck their thumbs like quarterbacks
I can get even faster, my zero-to-sixty
Or I’ll throw that three-point
Do whatevеr you like
Just follow my lead
Melodiеs flow out with my touch
I thought you were an instrument
Play it like I’m a pro
Even I’m envious of myself
I’ll run to you in a single step
If you just make one call
You come down in slippers to greet me, and I hold you
In the elevator, we’re already
Turning up harder than World DJ Festival
Before it gets deeper, let’s hurry
Make it happen like we’re checking in
Guess I gotta go swimming, swimming


[Chorus: HAON]
Like hold up
Wait a minute
Would you let me appulse (applause?)
I’ve arrived in front of your house
Without navigation
I’m all in when it’s you, if I throw it
Like I’m LeBron
From minutes before I arrive, my imagination is already running wild
Beep beep, I honked
Don’t even need GPS
You gon' make me happy, yeah
Even though I’m smiling, I’m serious
Winning every day, you’re my PS5
Life with you is a fiesta
Dodging all my worries
Skrr, skrr, skrr, ha


[Verse 2: GISELLE]
Mmm, I can feel it, you’re feeling
Something bigger, I’m stealing your heart
You’re trusting and craving
For me—what are you trying to be?
'Cause I heard you pulled up on my street
But my heart is still at 50%
While you’re running like Mach 200
Wishing I was right there with you, but I’m not
I wish it were just a misunderstanding
'Cause I feel the pull, yeah, I want ya
Want you to be choosy with me
Don’t need to take time, keep it real with me
If it’s not genuine, it won’t work—not on me
Fake shhh, I’m so tired of it
I don’t want to be realistic
Because this isn’t something that happens between us
Let me tell you two things
Then elaborate
My heart takes time, but I kinda like the pain




[Chorus: GISELLE]
Hold up, wait a minute
Do you wanna come by?
You’re already on your way, but I had to ask anyway
Even though it’s late, I had so much to say
But your text makes everything disappear, so I call you
Right now, I’m bored
But I’m seriously serious
Don’t be stressing, I’m just messing with your head
Keeping it light and fun
But I’m curious
Do you feel the same too?
Skrr, skrr on my trust issues
Come and skrr, skrr, boy

toxic till the end

[Verse 1]
Call us what we are, toxic from the start
Can't pretend that I was in the dark
When you met my friends, didn't even try with them
I should've known right then


[Pre-Chorus]
That you were jealous and possessive
So manipulatin'
Honestly, impressive
You had me participatin'




[Chorus]
Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
I said, "I never wanna see your face"
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end
Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closеr?"
You were plotting how to stay in my head
Wе were toxic till the end


[Interlude]
Ladies and gentlemen
I present to you
The ex


[Verse 2]
His favourite game is chess, who would ever guess?
Playing with the pieces in my chest
Now he's on the screen and saying, "Don't leave"
You stole that line from me


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're just jealous and possessive
So manipulatin'
Honestly, impressive
You had me participatin'

You heard, "Baby, can you pull me in closer?"
You were plotting how to stay in my head

I can forgive you for a lot of things
For not giving me back my Tiffany rings
I'll never forgive you for one thing, my dear
You wasted my prettiest years

Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
I said, "I never wanna see your face"
