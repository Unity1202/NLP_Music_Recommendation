[Intro]
Hey, hey
Pretty
Myth Syzer came through here
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl


[Verse 1]
Pretty girl didn't ask for this, I came to shake up her life (Her life, her life, her life)
She likes when I talk about my life, I tell her a bunch of lies (Hmm, hmm)
She liked the handsome man full of vigor (Of vigor)
She boarded the train without a Navigo pass
Come aboard, I hope you like speed
And it's speeding up, speeding up, speeding up, in her head, it's speeding up
And it's speeding up, in her hеart, I fill it up, the tank was empty, oh, baby
Yes, it's going fast, but too fast, I'm usually not into this
I just camе to give it to you dirty


[Chorus]
For her, I had the words, I got her addicted
She saw her life in my arms
For her, I had the words, I got her addicted
She saw her life in my arms
For her, I had the words


[Verse 2]
Eh, check, check, she wants to test me (Check, check), compare me to your exes, I'm the same species
Don't even think you're the first girl that's tried to test me (Check, check, check)
It's dead, I'm one of these scrap dogs you can't tame
She wants to test everything, yeah (Yeah), forget it, there's nothing to test with me
Believe me, bae, you'll suffer with me
And of all the women I made suffer, you're the only one that I'll remember
You're the only relationship in my life that makes me feel all that with nothing but a smile
In bed, I took pleasure in it, deep down, you're the only one I want
But nah, a man, since we're only here to do you dirty


[Chorus]
For her, I had the words, I got her addicted
She saw her life in my arms
For her, I had the words, I got her addicted
She saw her life in my arms
For her, I had the words

Young Bouba got the sauce
Mm, mm


[Verse 1]
Hold up, I pull up, look at the charisma
Don't put it on your story, I'm blacklisted in Paris
In the VIP section, only ten out of tens
I'm in the danger zone (Ah, ah, ah, ah)


[Pre-Chorus]
I saw you on the road, you were acting shy
You saw me come out of a six-figure car
I saw your smile, so you aren't shy
I have a lot of enemies, I'll roll up the window


[Chorus]
Deep down, you know it, I do it to keep you close to me
My baby, you know me, I do it to keep you close to me
Deep down, you know it, I do it to keep you close to me
My baby, you know me, I do it to keep you close to me


[Verse 2]
I'll tell you in a more poetic way
You're my oasis in this arid capital
Arid capital so we slip away
In the danger zone (Ah, ah, ah, ah)



[Pre-Chorus]
I saw you on the road, you were acting shy
You saw me come out of a six-figure car
I saw your smile, so you aren't shy
I have a lot of enemies, I'll roll up the window


[Chorus]
Deep down, you know it, I do it to keep you close to me
My baby, you know me, I do it to keep you close to me
Deep down, you know it, I do it to keep you close to me
My baby, you know me, I do it to keep you close to me


[Post-Chorus]
By my side, by your side, by my side, by your side
By my side, by your side, by my side for eternity
By your side, by my side, by your side for eternity
By your side, listening to me, by your side for eternity


[Pre-Chorus]
I saw you on the road, you were acting shy
You saw me come out of a six-figure car
I saw your smile, so you aren't shy
I have a lot of enemies, I'll roll up the window


[Chorus]
Deep down, you know it, I do it to keep you close to me
My baby, you know me, I do it to keep you close to me
Deep down, you know it, I do it to keep you close to me
My baby, you know me, I do it to keep you close to me
[Outro]
You were acting shy
Six-figure car
You aren't shy
Roll up the window

Hot three times, Didi Stone


[Chorus: Tiakola]
Make way for the Fashion Street, middle finger to the press
I'll ask you the burning question, whose clothes did you wear to blow up?
Let's speak Français, let's speak French, today, everyone needs to know
Detached, we just need to cut ties, don't look at my fucking face
She tastes like a Paris-Brest, to have her, you need to get in line
For a long relation, I need to stack, for a long relation, I need to stack (For a long)

Manon Bresch, Manon Bresch, make me dream, Manon Bresch

Two-three millions, I know my sport, I ship off the grams (Eh)
It's been so long since “La Fierté des Nôtres”, those that acted tough turned cute, yeah, yeah
From time to time (Time to time), two-three LV and Prada bags (Prada)
Mannequin size, that's my diva, hot three times, Didi Stone
End up like dad in full Weston (Full Weston), I'm writing the story like the Rolling Stones (Rolling Stones)

My sweetheart is hot, yeah, yeah, Tina Kunakey (Pah, pah, pah, pah)

Let's speak Français, let's speak French (Let's speak French), today, everyone needs to know (To know)
Detached, we just need to cut ties (Just to cut ties), don't look at my fucking face (Fucking face)
She tastes like a Paris-Brest (Paris-Brest), to have her, you need to get in line
For a long relation, I need to stack, for a long relation, I need to stack (For a long)

You recognized me at the red light, strapped in the Benz
If you invite us, of course we'll come, bring your clique
Don't worry, we'll hold, we'll block the VIP (It's crazy)
We leave them nothing, we don't suck dick, you know it well

[Intro: SDM]
The sound of the, the sound of the, the sound of the (Grr)
Grr, grr
Ocho, Ocho


[Verse 1 : SDM]
Today I'm an early bird, marginal line of work
I'm determined, I feel like CR7 about to take La Decima (Hard)
Why do you take it so personally? You're my guy, but you're pessimistic
Together for life, together 'til death, the contract's already signed (Arriba, arriba)
We've known each other for years, I admit, I'd have never imagined that
I put my balls down on the meza, fill up the table with trophies likе Messi
I don't even havе time to open your messages anymore, I'm the kid from the hood that became the big man
Well received on each floor: “Would you like champ', or Hennessy, Mr. Ocho ?” (Ocho)
A Hermès belt holding the iron, the sound of the, the sound of the, you reach the stars (Rah)
A Hermès belt holding the iron, the sound of the (Tew), the sound of the (Tew), you reach the stars


[Pre-Chorus: SDM]
Last night you were so beautiful, I had my hand on you, I let you decide
Oh, my iron, when I have you with me, I feel so handsome (Real)
My hand on you, I let you decide, body drawn with chalk, oh (Arriba)


[Chorus: SDM]
Send an address so we fight
The sound of the, the sound of the, the sound of the Tokarev
Send an address so we fight
The sound of the, the sound of the, the sound of the Tokarev


[Verse 2: Hamza]
The girl is thick as hell, the batteries are well recharged
We've got the whips and APs, now we need the market shares
The sound of the 3.5.7, one more star in the sky
I come from so far away, baby, all these diamonds on you remind me
Why are you playing with me, I'm about to go crazy
But, boy, he didn't even see them come at night, they did him in the middle of the afternoon
Jealousy has no face, a bit like the Tokarev
Already done, I repaint her face then I light up a cigarette
Right now I'm counting millions, my baby, I'm too busy
I'll admit, it's hard for me to make the right decisions in front of her low-cut
And I send you so much Dom Pérignon, they're having a hard time holding it, eh
I'm only good at collecting, my bills, I'm only good at collecting them (Tew, tew)


[Pre-Chorus: SDM]
Last night you were so beautiful, I had my hand on you, I let you decide
Oh, my iron, when I have you with me, I feel so handsome (Real)
My hand on you, I let you decide, body drawn with chalk, oh (Arriba)


[Chorus: SDM]
Send an address so we fight
The sound of the, the sound of the, the sound of the Tokarev
Send an address so we fight
The sound of the, the sound of the, the sound of the Tokarev


[Outro: SDM]
Send an address so we fight
Send an address so we fight

Sold out concert in Düsseldorf
Pumped up like Usain Bolt
I'm in the boat, I'm going through the era
I'm shopping on a day off
The jet lands in Lausanne (Lausanne)
And I'm dressеd like Muzan (Muzan)
And dark glasses when I see thеm (Ah)
Mysterious like Oda (One Piece)

Excess of love, I think I'll pass my turn
We have everything to take, but it depends on us
I left the towers, but the heart is in the trap
My feelings in a sequential box
Oh, oh don't invite her to the hood, she'll panic the traphouse (Yeah)
Panic the traphouse, panic the traphouse
Oh, oh don't invite her to the hood, she'll panic the traphouse (Yeah)
Panic the traphouse, panic the traphouse (Mmh-mmh)

Again, I admit, it's the same movie
I talk about the struggle and the truth
Turn up the volume a little
Eros, run it up


[Chorus]
They spit, they talk shit
I swear, the state of the zone, you should've seen it, arrival (I whistle the flow, they talk shit)
Never give them the respect you don't yet have
They spit, they talk shit
I swear, the state of the zone, you should've seen it, arrival (I whistle the flow, they talk shit)
Never give them the respect you don't yet have


[Verse 1]
I'm never quick, always in spirit
In front of the barrel, you can't be laughing, these idiots, they shot Béné
New business, here come the whispers
Needa find a way to get out of here, they get stuffed at the store
I'll take my own spot, I don't want to get sat down
In front of the barrel, you can't be laughing, these idiots, they shot Béné
I'll take my own spot, I don't want to get sat down
Needa find a way to get out of here, they get stuffed at the store
I know I haven't yet seen the best-est
There's hash, there's Cali
In the studio there's a selection, ha-yeah, hey
I have way too much empathy, I'll stop, who do I start with?
I know misery, I rode too long in the zone
They fucked him up, he thought he could boss us around
You know we don't care about the laws, I spend everything in the tower
I do what I want, I do what I want


[Bridge]
I fell in love with the money
I could've given everything, everything, everything, everything
He was giving blowjobs for a seventh
What would he do for an ounce?
I fell in love with the money
I could've given everything, everything, everything, everything
He was giving blowjobs for a seventh
What would he do for an ounce?


[Couplet 2]
If I get what I want, that's good enough
Over the years, where we at now?
I want to shine like Ferrara
I haven't even seen the worst, I'm waiting for the best (The best)
Maybe next, you'll pretend like you don't know
I better not see you in the bushes
You could end up on the makila
You hide, who'd you fuck over?
Ain't no more pirates, no shoulder on which to lean on
Well yeah, bro, even in a suit it's the streets, karai
Change the movie, it's always the same thing
Hooded, gloves, 9-4, south of Paris
Just one million and I swear we'll be good
Just ten million and I swear we'll be good
You know, from my eyes, life's not so beautiful
What I hear being said, honestly, I don't appreciate
[Refrain]
They spit, they talk shit (They spit, they talk shit)
I swear, the state of the zone, you should've seen it, arrival (I whistle the flow, they talk shit)

Hey, I load bullets into the magazine (Magazine)
Bitch can't reach my heart (hah-hah)
Insane racks like an elephant, we were miserable, but God changed my life (Racks)
In any case, I've got the wrong profile
Fuck snitches and pedophiles
You fell in love with a crazy bitch, she might've gone back and forth in the hotels around here (Around here)
Pow, pow, that's the only way out (Pow)
I came from below, I have to finish on top
Stop talking, do it discreetly (Huh-huh)
On her fat ass, I play some djembe
I like when the girl sucks well, I like that
She's got flow, she dresses well, I like that
When the stack is nice and compact
We've had everything for a while, now we've got to eat
Implicated for a long time
All you have left, we'll turn it to crumbs
Politicians manipulate us
You think you're hot but you suck
We enter the bedroom, she gets naked
Latina pussy on the menu
Do you see how much hate I have?
I know I could die on the road
I know I could die in the trenches
I know how to touch her G spot

Stop lying, you aren't a plug
From time to time, bad luck gives me hugs
Taxes take you by the ass
Actually, I don't think you get it



[Bridge]
Actually, I don't think you get it
It's Mozart Captain Jackson on the track
Tell your bitch to get off my dick
Pa-para-pop if you come as a group

I get paranoid, take out the Tokarev
Then I crash the truck into him
It's L.E.T.O going bada-boom

2K on the track, bitch
Hmm
Hmm
It's Dadi I told you
As a kid, I thought life was like Disney
15 years later, in front of the mirror, I ask, “Who is this guy?”
Lots of things sadden me but
I keep my mentality, I have to fuck everything up to shut them up
Baby wants me to give her a baby, but I am one myself
Time passes quickly, 2nd grade’s so far away
On Netflix like Omar Sy, I thank God
They say it's easy
Yet they keep missing the target
Alcohol leaving the urethra to be free
You could be anyone, respect, and I'll hold you in high esteem
I’ll never forget those that thought we were crazy in the process
They're the same that say they know us to girls, yeah, for some ass, they'll glaze
I could rap while fasting or even drunk, I'm filled with talent
I leave my issues, fuck the cops
I've got to fuck them, success awaits


[Bridge]
Success awaits
I've gotta fuck them (Hm, hm, hm)
Success awaits
Awake since this morning



[Verse 1]
(It's Dadi I told you)
How's it been going all this time? I know you don’t have the time, at the same time, I get it, that’s life
I know your ex hurt your little sapphire heart
Give me one chance, and it'll work even if I have other girls in line
I’m stunned, let me tell you, I'm serious, I'm telling you


[Pre-Chorus]
Come, let's mess around, well yeah
I partied all night, and I only have you in my head
Come, let’s mess around, well yeah
On top of that, you're perfect, you make my head spin


[Chorus]
Come, let's mess around, well yeah
I partied all night, and I only have you in my head
Come, let's mess around, well yeah
On top of that, you're perfect, you make my head spin


[Verse 2]
I'm a special boy looking for
His special girl, in truth, nothing abnormal
I'm also suspicious, my heart's been broken
So I hurt them back, I ain't proud, it's normal
I hurt some people, I wrapped it up
Girls or drugs, I wrapped it up
Fuck it's annoying, once you're in it, it's death or handcuffs on your wrists
I saw you got carried away
Don't make a scene, we'll talk
Here, there's too many people, that's not my thing, so come with me, let's talk
[Pre-Chorus]
Come, let's mess around, well yeah
I partied all night, and I only have you in my head
Come, let's mess around, well yeah
On top of that, you're perfect, you make my head spin

Come, let's mess around, well yeah
I partied all night, and I only have you in my head

Tell me if it happens


[Chorus: FloyyMenor]
Ba-ba-baby, go on, get ready for me, follow me
You are like for me and I am for you
Girl, you're alone, send me your location


Move your ass to the rhythm of the TikTok
That girl ran away with me and nobody noticed at home
Because with me that baby had a grеat time tonight
Girl, put the cellphonе on airplane mode
You're my crazy girl and I'm your crazy guy
You make yourself for me and I'll go all in


[Refrain: FloyyMenor & Cris Mj]
Baby, I feel you far away, tell me where you are (Ah-ah)
I want to fuck you, I'm gonna take you away
Let yourself go, turn off the cellphone
'Cause if you're with me, nothing will happen to you
Just let yourself go
Baby, watch out for the play
I want it with you and you want it with me (Mj)
(Tell me if it happens)


[Chorus: Cris Mj]
Ba-ba-baby, go on, get ready for me, follow me
You are like for me, I'm your Brad Pitt
Girl, you're only, send me your location
Move it, dance to the rhythm of the TikTok
That girl ran away with me
The one who fucks her is me
I stole her when we were young


[Verse: Cris Mj & FloyyMenor]
Another night giving you (Eh), giving you (Eh)
Touching you (Eh), heating you up
Climaxing on top of you (Okay)
Moaning in my ear (Ha)
And I keep making her fall in love, giving her presents, buying stuff all day long
Whatever you want, baby girl
Now we're drifting apart, I'm not seeing you, the days go by
Being alone is what you prefer
Come and give me a chance to grind on you
To get you all wet down there
Another night giving you, giving you
Touching you, heating you up


[Chorus: Cris Mj]
Baby, go on, get ready for me, follow me
You are like for me, I'm your Brad Pitt
Girl, you're only, send me your location
Move it, dance to the rhythm of the TikTok
That girl ran away with me
The one who fucks her is me
I stole her when we were young

(Baby, I feel you far away, tell me where you are)
(I want to fuck you, I'm gonna take you away)
(Let yourself go, turn off the cellphone)
('Cause if you're with me, nothing will happen to you)
You and me in La Serena
On the Avenida del Mar

What you thinking, Chris ? Ahah
If I disappear, I'm working hard, to stop me, I'll need a big hit
Check the size of my living room
If I disappear, I'm working hard, to stop me, I'll need a big hit
Check the size of my living room


[Verse 1]
If I disappear, I'm working hard, to stop, I'll need a big hit
Or, I'll need a big check the size of my living room
180, two-time, it's fast, it's winter but the hood's revived
The cops are too slow, Quechua, neck gaiter, heated gloves
I know the price, guess who's bringing it down, the green comes down from the Netherlands
I got back safe, believe me for six figures, we'rе going
Come and visit the sandmen if you want to sleep
I'm stuck in thе dirt with the same number


[Pre-Chorus]
It's not my fault if you haven't heard from me in months
Keep your issues away from me
It's not my fault if you haven't heard from me in months
Keep your issues away from me


[Chorus]
Problems on problems, moolah, moolah, bunch of green bills
I was small and vulgar, I brought back issues to the house
Bullet on bullet hole, I think in my own bubble
Unlimited mileage, pedal to the metal, I accelerate



[Verse 2]
And they didn't hold out their hand, I didn't wait for their help
There was no one for me, I was riding in the wrong direction
As a kid I saw myself as an astronaut, but I didn't stay a kid, so I didn't become an astronaut and I roll rockets, not small joints
The kid doesn't dream about a 50 anymore, the sound of the shifter gets him hard
Audacity pays, I came in without introducing myself
Since a kid in the street, I started off with a handicap
Eyes bigger than my stomach, I make the Audi Cab's exhaust spit


[Pre-Chorus]
It's not my fault if you haven't heard from me in months
Keep your issues away from me
It's not my fault if you haven't heard from me in months
Keep your issues away from me


[Chorus]
Problems on problems, moolah, moolah, bunch of green bills
I was small and vulgar, I brought back issues to the house
Bullet on bullet hole, I think in my own bubble
Unlimited mileage, pedal to the metal, I accelerate
Problems on problems, moolah, moolah, bunch of green bills
I was small and vulgar, I brought back issues to the house
Bullet on bullet hole, I think in my own bubble
Unlimited mileage, pedal to the metal, I accelerate

She wants me to love her, but I'm a mess

She wants my tchigidji-tchigidji, never
I'm like Arafat in coupé-décalé
There's an issue, I don't call the po-po, never

Avant-garde, we didn't take the elevator (No), scavenger, I had to break the rules
It's God that gives even if it's dirty money (Dirty), we'll deal with them at anytime (What'd you say?)
She's hot, she's pretty, she's bad (Bad), Twelve-thirty, she awaits in her room
On the side, I set up the mic (Mic), if there's an issue, you just have to call (Hello?)

We come back on bikes when shit pulls up, more than ten-year long friendships in the circle (Yeah)
More than ten-year long friendships in the circle (Yeah), I'm on top at the Burberry offices
Too paranoid to associate myself, but I'd like to dine on occasion (On occasion)
Baby, outside it's already complicated, I've got my brother, my straps, my lawyer


[Pre-Chorus: Ninho & Niska]
No it ain't over, I haven't let go since the hood up there (Since the hood up there)
Checkered shirt, buying jewels up to Monaco (Up to Monaco)

Despite myself, I'm enemy number one
Delicate hand game, Coco


[Chorus 2: Ninho]
Delicate hand game, Coco Chanel
Charles de Gaulles-N'djili, I'm too jet-lagged
She wants my cash, Pharrell's salary (Eh, eh)
Always a click-click, we never know

Needa sell CDs to fill up the card, always been the same team since I was a child
So it'll be the same team with the million, from now on, they love my rap and my melodies
She says I'm cute, I gotta make mama proud, the road is long like the Millau Viaduct
In the middle of the road I can't stop here, look at my dark circles, my lifestyle says a lot
Boy, I need a bitch, I need a wagz, I could kill when the girl puts on her wig (Mama-eh)
I need to rob them to buy a watch, cutting classes, yet you see me in A Class
I need me a beautiful ebony, perfect figure like Aya, I believe in God, I ain't a pagan
I look at them over there, they're all fake, boy


[Chorus]
They're all fake, boy, our turf is rigged, boy
Our turf is rigged, boy, our turf is rigged, boy

Imagine
Carbonne
She says: “Imagine Madeira under the umbrellas”
But now I imagine losing her, I get paranoid
I'm losing my mind, she's right, I think she wants my name behind her first name
She's never betrayed me, no, that's what's making my head spin


[Chorus]
She says: “Imagine Madeira under the umbrellas”
But now I imagine losing her, I get paranoid
I'm losing my mind, she's right, I think she wants my name behind her first name
She's never betrayed me, no


[Verse 1]
She wants to see Madagascar, I want to see clearly, she wants to leave Paris, have a change of scenery
She likes walks and simple things, she doesn't envy the life of a billionaire
Even when she works me, tests me, when my guard is down
I can't leave her, she makes me happy, she knows I get lost in her eyes
I love her qualities, her flaws, when I said “I love you” to others, it was false
Small glass of rum, I'll sit down, think back to when I was poor
We want to change our lives, change the weather, yeah, degrees in the air, in the glass: equal
Far from trams and metro platforms, both of us on the GTO motorbike


[Chorus]
She says: “Imagine Madeira under the umbrellas”
But now I imagine losing her, I get paranoid
I'm losing my mind, she's right, I think she wants my name behind her first name
She's never betrayed me, no
That's what's making my head spin


[Verse 2]
She wants to see Rome and Rio, Buenos Aires, Rosario
Get far away from Paris, on the lands of Dalí, get far from the sirens, the flashing lights
She wants to see Venice, she wants to see Rome and Rio, Buenos Aires, Rosario
Get far away from Paris, on the lands of Dalí, get far from the sirens, the flashing lights
At first, she laughed in my face when she saw how I was fluttering
But it became passionate, we have so many roads to take
We talk about living in front of the ocean, I can tell she isn't a homebody
At night, she's got the art, the skills, she's my Falbala, my cavalier


[Bridge]
She says: “Imagine Madeira under the umbrellas” (¡Vamo', vamo', vamo'!)
But now I imagine losing her, I get paranoid (¡Ola!)
I'm losing my mind, she's right, I think she wants my name behind her first name
She's never betrayed me, no, (¡Lleva, lleva!)


[Chorus]
She says: “Imagine Madeira under the umbrellas”
But now I imagine losing her, I get paranoid
I'm losing my mind, she's right, I think she wants my name behind her first name
She's never betrayed me, no

I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you
I love you, I hate you, I love you, I hate you


[Verse 1: Stromae]
You're the best thing to ever happen to me
But also the worst thing to ever happen to me
On that day when I met you, maybe I would rather
That it never happened to me (To me)
The worst of all blessings
The best of all cursеs


I should stray away from you
But as the saying goes
"Bettеr than alone, is to be in bad company"




[Pre-Chorus: Stromae, Stromae & Pomme, Pomme]
You know what they say
Stay close to your dearest friends
But also
Even closer to your adversaries




[Chorus: Stromae & Pomme]
But my best enemy is you


Flee from me, the worst is you and I


But if you keep searching for my voice
Forget me, the worst is you and I


[Verse 2: Pomme]
Why does hearing your name hurt me


When it hides right there in the vicinity?
What kind of emotion, is it hatred
Or pure sweetness when I hear your name?




[Pre-Chorus: Pomme]
I had told you, not to keep looking behind
Your past will follow you and wage war on you


[Chorus: Stromae & Pomme]
But my best enemy is you


Flee from me, the worst is you and I


But my best enemy is you
Flee from me, the worst is you and I

Be straight up with me (Ibiza, Ibiza), be straight up with me, oh, no, no
Be straight up with me (Ibiza, Ibiza), be straight up with me, oh, no, no


[Verse 1: Damso]
I fucked up again (Shit), you know the night, Tequila Sol
I went off the rails, I released my demons on her fat ass
The evening was worthwhile, I drop the bomb, I end up in her story
I'm horrible, I take out her Tampax, you alrеady know, it all went so fast

My gyal your flow's sweet
You know I always have something brand new (New)
To see me, you gotta book a rendezvous
I have as many women as I have money
I'll let you pick, make love or break your neck
Real bad man, I'll do it any day
I met your mother with a box of jewels
I'm a vagrant according to your father
He says you can't be with me, a bad boy
I'm a vagrant according to your father
Like Vybz Kartel, he says I'm a bandit, kiss me, baby

The distance that separates us will last only the time of a drink, don't worry

I love you too
Eh (Eh)


[Verse]
You'll need trust and courage, a relationship full of rage that starts off on rotten bases (Uh, uh)
She left me, sad to death, while her heart screamed “Hurray” and mine was broken in thousands of pieces (Uh, uh)
Down here, we call you “the social media girl” (Uh, uh)
I always thought I was alone, that I was number 1, in fact, I had so many rivals (Ocho)
Known around the city, no clear goal in life
My hash stashed in the basement, she came into my life to make up for the void
On my mama's life, babe, my car without gas, I can be your BP (Vrmm, vrmm, vrmm, vrmmm)
Shе knew how to talk to me, within two, three dates, I startеd dreaming about her (Eh, eh)
I've only taken on me, since the beginning, she's only wanted to take my money (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
When I had nothing, no worries for her, in any case, I was eighth in line (Ocho)
You'll need trust and courage, a relationship full of rage, I never see the sun, only storms (Uh, uh)
She wants me to tattoo her name, to cut off my entourage, the latest Courrèges collection
My God, what movie are we in? How did I get attached without even knowing her? (Uh, uh)
She wants this, she wants that, yet, I was told that money doesn't buy happiness
I eliminate her, I've seen enough, she's just a bitch, I assimilate her to these
Oh-la-la, not so fast, she tells me “Don't move, your blood, I didn't drink enough”
I don't take on me anymore, that's over, I've thought about it all week
She asks me “Are you sure?”, tells me “Too bad, I cleared out my night so that you could get on top of me”
Suddenly, I'm heartbroken, She can pinpoint exactly where to hit to make me switch (Eh, eh)
It's my mouth that said "no", even though my heart wanted to say "yes", while my brain asked itself what I was doing
You'll need trust and courage, a relationship full of rage, in the end, I didn't get over it (Uh, uh, uh)
Living without her, I couldn't do it, I can't find sleep when I'm sober, I go to bed after a few glasses (Ocho, ocho)
She acts like everything's okay, new relationship, she lives the life she's always dreamed of (The dream life)
For her, I wasn't capable enough, a capable enough man would've pulled up to her place in a Ferrari (Pam, pam, pam, pam)



[Outro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
I tell her: “I can't live without you”, she tells me: “Only if you buy me a Cartier Santos”
Even with all the time we spend together, you don't want to take this a bit more seriously?
You know money doesn't count, you'll realize one day how much I loved you
I tell her I wish her all the best, she tells me “Wish me wealth, fuck health”

[Verse 1]
I'm not looking for the good life, but I'll find it
I'm far from the pretty girls that ran
Behind me and died for me
I'm not in the neighborhood anymore, lot less people around me
I've got some issues but don't worry about it
I won't tell you anything, because you never shut up
I liked hanging around, coming home late
People disgust me, time for Netflix and joint
I saw you when I was passing by, if you thought I looked weird
It's either because you hurt me or you're a yes man
I know the jealous ones have me in their sights
Now when I come home, I glance in the rearview mirror
I worked hard, I didn't get here by mistake
What's in the hideout ain't for nothing
My little baggie at 5pm in the bag


[Chorus]
I've got my brain smoking
Leave me, I'm under the moon
And I've seen more than one
So I do Vodka-Schweppes Agrum
I've got my brain smoking
Leave me, I'm under the moon
And I've seen more than one
So I do Vodka-Schweppes Agrum

[Verse 2]
And all this time you've been crazy, you've still been greeting me
But you gotta go through that, to learn about people and their vices
This summer I need to go to the bush, big up to those who'll see on the Talkie
Big up to those on Yamaha R1s doing wheelies at Versys, Kawasaki 1000
You know nothing, yet you pull up
See, I laugh but I'm not too happy
I'm nobody, but there's gold in my heart
I'm strong because I've seen horrors


[Chorus]
I've got my brain smoking
Leave me, I'm under the moon
And I've seen more than one
So I do Vodka-Schweppes Agrum

All I Want for Christmas Is You
Mariah Carey
[Intro]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah




[Verse 1]
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need (And I)
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree


I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace (Ah)


Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day




[Chorus]
I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby



[Verse 2]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow (And I)


I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe


I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click




[Chorus]
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby




[Bridge]
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)


And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door




[Chorus]
Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you




[Outro]
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (Ah, oh, ah, oh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (You)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I really want, baby, ooh)
All I want for Christmas is you, baby (All I want, all I really want is you)

Last Christmas
Wham!
[Intro]
(Happy Christmas)
Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh


[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away


This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special


Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)


This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)


[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy


I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye


Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me


"Happy Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again


[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)


This year, to save me from tears


I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away


This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby


[Verse 2]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on


Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on


A face-on lover with a fire in his heart


A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again


[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)


This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away)


This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
[Verse 3]
A face-on lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man undercover, but you tore him apart


Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special


[Bridge]
Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Who give me something in return
(I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone)
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day?
I thought you were someone special
I gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone


[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
You gave it away


I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

Die With A Smile
Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars


[Intro: Bruno Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)


[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized




[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night




[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you




[Post-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)



[Verse 2: Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for


[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night




[Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you




[Bridge: Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga & Both]
Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh
[Chorus: Lady Gaga, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars, Bruno Mars]
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you




[Outro: Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)
I'd wanna be next to you
